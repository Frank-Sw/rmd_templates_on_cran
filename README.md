# R markdown templates on CRAN

This shiny app will do a github API search on the github CRAN mirror and find out all R markdown templates on CRAN.

If people like it, I can try to add continuous integration to this project to improve the speed. Also, with CI, ultimately, we can even provide document preview in theory.
